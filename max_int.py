# Design an algorithm that finds the maximum positive integer input by a user.  
# The user repeatedly inputs numbers until a negative value is entered.


# The program runs while user puts in positive numbers, 
# When the user puts in a negative number the loop stops
# The program then prints out the highest number the user entered
